          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
          I was brought onto the Gap Labs innovation team to help build digital platforms for inventory management, planning, and in-season execution. After familiarizing myself with retail processes and vernacular, I was took ownership as lead designer for a suite of tools known as “Product-End-to-End”, or PETE for short. These products are vital for modernizing the way that planners, buyers, merchants, and business analysts perform their critical business operations. I was responsible for a variety of tasks such as user research, testing, wireframing, prototyping, and implementing designs into the web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I worked closely with business analysts, product managers, and software engineers to ensure that we were making the best design decisions during each iteration of the project. 
          </p>

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>When I was first introduced to new projects, I saw that there was a lot of room for improvement and I had great UXpections; however, before I jumped to conclusions, I consulted with project managers and users to get a better understanding of the problems. I conducted user research to further understand pain points in our applications and worked closely with engineers to make MVP prototypes that alleviated our users problems. I created wireframes which were refined into polished UI specs which were validated by project stakeholders. After validation, I was in charge of implementing the design into my own git branch which would be verified by an engineer and merged into the master branch of the application.</p>
          <p>The Gap planning products covers a wide breadth of business functions and there are several siloed teams that loosely adhered to a visual standard. Many of the interfaces shared little to nothing in common: developing a consistent image was one of my top priorities. With oversight from the department executives, I created new branding guidelines and an online style guide that included a new logo, color palette, typography, and even code snippets for common interactions. This one was of my most rewarding experiences because every member of our department was highly engaged with the project. After several weeks, our team landed the most favorable direction and today my guidelines are the foundation and visual standard for all products in the PETE suite.</p>

          </div>

          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>Over the course of several months, I worked in an agile environment and effectively managed my time, hit key deadlines, and made great improvements with my team members. I conquered one of my biggest fears, git change management and most importantly, I enjoyed working with a diverse group of talented people and learned a lot of valuable lessons in software development.</p>

          <p>&quot;I've been working with Matt for only four months, but in that time he's demonstrated exceptional skills. Matt is unique in his ability to thrive in an Agile development environment, which is often challenging for UX designers. He spreads his time between multiple projects and is able to juggle competing priorities with ease. Most recently, I asked Matt to conceptualize a full UX redesign and he delivered a functional prototype well ahead of, and above, my expectations. Matt would be a valuable addition to any organization in need of UX/UI expertise.&quot;</p>
